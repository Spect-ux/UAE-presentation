      <p>The United Arab Emirates has a population of about 9.5 million people,
        making it one of the most diverse countries in the world. Emirati citizens
        are a minority, while most residents are expatriates who come from many
        different countries for work and better opportunities.
        
        People in the UAE come from many ethnic backgrounds, including Arabs,
        South Asians, Africans, Europeans, and East Asians. The country celebrates
        this diversity by promoting tolerance, allowing freedom of religion, and
        hosting cultural events and festivals that bring different communities together
        and encourage respect and unity.

      <p>The UAE is home to a wide variety of languages due to its
        multicultural population. Arabic is the official language and
        is widely used in government, education, and cultural traditions.
        
        However, English is commonly spoken and serves as a main language
        for business and daily communication. Many other languages, such as
        Hindi, Urdu, Malayalam, Tagalog, and Bengali, are also widely spoken,
        reflecting the diverse communities living in the country and making the
        UAE a truly multilingual society.
