    </summary>
    <div class="card-details">
      <p>The kandura is a traditional men’s garment worn across the Arabian Gulf.
        Typically white, it reflects heat and offers comfort in warm climates.
        Known for its simple, flowing design, the kandura represents elegance, modesty,
        and cultural pride, often worn for both daily life and special occasions.</p>
      <p>The abaya is a graceful outer garment worn by women, usually black, symbolizing
        modesty and sophistication. Designed to flow loosely, it combines tradition with
        modern style and is often paired with a hijab. The abaya reflects cultural heritage
        while allowing personal expression through subtle details and tailoring.</p>

        and dates as a symbol of respect, generosity, and warmth. The gentle pouring
        of coffee and the offering of dates reflect centuries-old traditions, where making
        a guest feel honored and at home is considered a cherished value.</p>
